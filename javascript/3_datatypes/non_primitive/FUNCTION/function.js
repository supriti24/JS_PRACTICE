// Simple Arrow Function: A basic example of an arrow function that adds two numbers.

// A function is a block of reusable code that can be executed when called. 
// Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, 
// meaning they can be treated like any other variable.

function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  }
  
  console.log(greet("John"));  // Output: Hello, John!
  console.log(typeof greet);  // Output: function
